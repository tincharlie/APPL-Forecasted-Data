Here we will take past data like and get the output. This output will consider as a input and predict another forecasted value.

For Example:
200, 250, 300 -- 250
250, 300, 250 -- 267
300, 250, 267 -- 272


This is how it works and after completion of that process we will get that approximate forecasted stock price on the daywise.

Lets Assume a use case:
We have 3 burger points in the city.
If we want to predict the sales of each one of the point. So in the A Burger Point need 220 burger, B point need 200 Burger, and c point need 300 burger. So on an average for tomorrow how Burger much they will need in all the Burger Point that we can forecaste on the basis of previous data.

Similarly We will take the day wise data and will do sum and average of it then we will get the forecaste.
